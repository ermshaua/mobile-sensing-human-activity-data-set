# MOSAD - Mobile Sensing Human Activity Data Set
This is the supporting website for the paper "Time Series Segmentation Applied to a New Data Set for Mobile Sensing of Human Activities". It contains the used source codes, the MOSAD data set, raw results, and analysis notebooks. It reflects the state of the paper for reproducibility and is purposely not further updated.

Human activity recognition (HAR) systems are advanced machine learning (ML) workflows that automatically detect activities from motion data, captured e.g. by wearable devices such as smartphones. These devices contain multiple sensors that record human motion as acceleration, rotation and orientation in long time series (TS) data. As a first step, HAR methods typically partition such recordings into smaller subsequences before applying more advanced feature extraction and classification techniques. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 6 classical and recently published state-of-the-art TS segmentation (TSS) algorithms on a new large HAR benchmark of 126 TS, called MOSAD, recorded with 6 participants using recent smartphone sensors. Our results show that the ClaSP algorithm achieves significantly more accurate results compared to the other methods, scoring the best segmentations in 57 out of 126 TS. This indicates that ClaSP can be a viable solution for TSS in HAR systems. Additionally, the FLOSS algorithm also shows promising results, particularly for long TS with many segments. However, there is still scope for performance improvements and further research is needed.

## Organisation

This repository is structured in the following way: 

- `benchmark` contains the source codes used for running the six TSS competitors on MOSAD.
- `datasets` consists of MOSAD as published in the study. It can be loaded with the data loader in `src/utils.py`.
- `experiments` contains the raw measurement sheets for the six competitors. It can be reproduced by running the scripts in the `benchmark` folder.
- `figures` includes the paper plots, generated by the Jupyter notebooks.
- `notebooks` consists of analysis, exploration and visualization Jupyter notebooks, used to explore MOSAD and evaluate the results in the `experiments` folder.
- `src` contains the sources codes for the six competitors and utility methods.

## Installation

You can download this repository (by clicking the download button in the upper right corner). As this repository is a supporting website and not an updated library, we do not recommend to install it! Download and use MOSAD and extract or adapt code snippets of interest.
